<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>The data must be prepared in a certain way before it is uploaded to the Statsomat app: 
Each row represents a record respectively an observation. Each column represents a variable respectively a parameter of interest. Do not store multiple variables in one column (for example sex and age in one column). Use distinct names as column names. Empty cells indicate missing values. Other character values (e.g. "NA") are not recognized as missing values. Once you have your data prepared in the specified way, save it with the CSV format. If your data file is in an Excel or LibreOffice format, you can try to convert it to CSV by selecting "Save As". Try to select the format CSV with the character encoding UFT-8, this helps reading the data correctly. You can also prepare or inspect the CSV file with a text editor like

As an example, you can find <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/reyar/Statsomat-CSV-Datasets/"><b>here</b></a> some prepared CSV dataset examples to be used with the Statsomat apps. </p> 
<p>When your data is ready, you can proceed with the upload to Statsomat. A couple of upload properties must be specified. If you are not sure about them, you can choose the option "Auto" for each property. In that case, 
Statsomat will try to identify automatically the right settings. In most of the cases, this will succeed. Otherwise, please consider alternative settings or data formats.</p>   
<p>After a successful upload of the data, you can proceed with the selection of the variables for the CFA model. Finally, type the CFA model equations in typical 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html"><b>lavaan model syntax.</b></a> An example is displayed which you can easily overwrite. If you expect certain signs for the factor loadings, then you can type them in next window. Use the pre-operator "+" or resp. "-" for each expected factor loading (do not forget the first one). </p>
<p>Now you can generate and finally download the report. To make use of the table of contents, open the report with a PDF reader (for example Adobe Acrobat Reader). To seamlessly copy the R code, open the report in the browser. Further instructions are included in the report. </p>
